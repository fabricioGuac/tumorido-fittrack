# Tumorido-fitTrack

## Description 

This project will be a full-stack application leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to create a comprehensive fit tracking app. It aims to help users monitor their fitness activities, and track progress through an interactive and mobile-friendly interface. The application will utilize GraphQL for efficient data querying and mutations, with JWT for  authentication. The app will be deployed on Render.

## Usage

FitTrack enables users to efficiently monitor their fitness progress by allowing them to input and track body metrics, such as measurements, weight, and gender, to calculate body fat percentage and visualize this data over time. Users can also log and analyze their lifting activities—including lift weight, exercise name, sets, and reps—through detailed graphs. The app features a comprehensive exercise database for searching exercises by muscle group or name, and offers personalized calorie and macronutrient recommendations based on user inputs and activity levels.
